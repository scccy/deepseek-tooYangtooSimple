 * Version of the `ds-harness-remote` distribution.

 * This is reported to the Server during device registration (`clientVersion`

 * Server can surface the plugin version in its device list and diagnostics.
 * Keep it in sync with `packages/plugin/package.json` (`version`).
 * If they diverge, `npm scripts` checks in `scripts/verify-version-sync.mjs`
 * will fail fast during build/check/test.
