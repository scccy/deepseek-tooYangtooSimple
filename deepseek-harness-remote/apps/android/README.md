# DSH Remote for Android

React Native / Expo SDK 57 client for controlling a trusted DeepSeek Harness host over the
[Remote Protocol v1](../docs/protocol.md) ApiProxy tunnel.

## Implemented flow

- Configure and health-check a Remote server (defaults to the official
  `https://dsh.r2049.cn`; override at build time with `EXPO_PUBLIC_DSH_REMOTE_SERVER`); sign in
  with the Server account once to register the Android device and rotate its access/refresh
  tokens in SecureStore.
- Generate a random Android client identity and keep its private key in Keystore-backed
  `expo-secure-store`.
- List same-account Harness hosts, fetch each host's authorized peer descriptor, verify its
  identity key, and pin it locally; a changed key fails closed and is never silently replaced.
- Establish a Noise IK channel over an adaptive transport (WebRTC P2P/TURN with Relay fallback) and
  reject tampered, replayed, or wrong-identity frames.
- Drive the Host's ApiProxy bridge through `harness.api.call/respond/stream.open/stream.close`:
  browse sessions (including archived ones), create sessions, stream live mux frames, send
  prompts, cancel generation, page older history, switch the active model from the host's
  catalog, manage host workspaces (create with a read-only directory browser, rename, delete,
  reorder), and answer approval / question requests with the native `client-response` envelope.
- Reconnect after Android network/app lifecycle changes. The connection transport can be
  pinned in Settings (Auto / TURN first / Relay only) and is applied on reconnect.

The app does not run in Expo Go because WebRTC includes native code. Use a development build.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @dsh-remote/android start
```

To generate and install the native Android development build:

```bash
pnpm --filter @dsh-remote/android android
```

Android Emulator reaches a server on the development machine at `http://10.0.2.2:8080`. Cleartext
HTTP is accepted only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `10.0.2.2`, and private-network addresses
(RFC1918 LAN ranges, link-local, and CGNAT such as Tailscale) by the client; public addresses and
production servers must use HTTPS/WSS.

## Validation

```bash
pnpm --filter @dsh-remote/android check
pnpm --filter @dsh-remote/android test
NODE_ENV=production pnpm --filter @dsh-remote/android build
pnpm dlx expo-doctor@latest

cd apps/android
pnpm exec expo prebuild --platform android
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Structure

```text
src/
  lib/       URL validation and user-facing errors
  screens/   server sign-in, devices, sessions, chat, settings
  services/  REST, secure storage, secure transport, ApiProxy tunnel client
  state/     Zustand store and mux-frame reducer
  ui/        tokens and reusable mobile components
```

The UI does not expose shell, filesystem, or arbitrary tool RPCs. Every Harness action goes through
the Host's fixed ApiProxy allowlist; Host policy remains authoritative.
